#
# A toy memory leak detector for ltrace
#
# This is a proof of concept work for detecting memory leaks from the output of
# ltrace. The idea is to simply trace malloc and free calls in an execution and
# report non-freed allocations in the end. Other allocation methods are not
# added to keep it simple.
#
# This can only detect the existence of leaks without showing the location of
# the allocations in the source code. Also, since this is a dynamic analysis
# method, absence of leaks does not necessarily mean the program is leak free
# for all execution paths. Therefore, this is not very useful in practice.
#
# To run the script, you need to redirect ltrace output from stderr to stdout,
# and then redirect regular output to null device, and pipe stdout to this
# script. An example for `ls` command is shown below:
#
#     ltrace ls 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null | ./leak.py
#

import re
import sys

lines = list(filter(lambda l: &quot;malloc&quot; in l or &quot;free&quot; in l, sys.stdin))

print(&quot;These are all the malloc and free calls in the execution&quot;)
for line in lines:
    print(line, end=&quot;&quot;)

mems = {}
for line in lines:
    toks = line.split()

    # malloc(size) = addr
    if &quot;malloc&quot; in toks[0]:
        size = re.search(r&quot;malloc\((.*)\)&quot;, toks[0]).group(1)
        addr = toks[2]
        mems[addr] = size

    # free(addr) = &lt;void&gt;
    elif &quot;free&quot; in toks[0]:
        addr = re.search(r&quot;free\((.*)\)&quot;, toks[0]).group(1)
        mems.pop(addr, None)

print()
print(&quot;Execution ended with the following non-freed allocations&quot;)
for k, v in mems.items():
    print(&quot;leaked&quot;, v, &quot;bytes of memory at&quot;, k)
